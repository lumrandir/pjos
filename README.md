PJOS (Prolog Jumping Over railS) is a simple web-based client-server
application written in Ruby (On Rails).

PJOS has but one purpose: to provide a bridge between human and the 
Prolog-based intelligence system using all the richness of modern 
web-interfaces.

You can freely clone and redistribute this application, I don't give a fuck.

Kiitos.
